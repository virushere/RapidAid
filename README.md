# Rapid Aid - Android Application for Emergency Services

RapidAid is an Android application designed to streamline emergency services and improve response times during critical situations. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between emergency service providers and traffic police, ultimately saving lives through efficient coordination.

## Overview

In times of emergency, every second counts. RapidAid addresses the challenges faced by emergency services in reaching their destinations quickly, especially during peak traffic hours. By leveraging modern mobile technology and cloud-based services, this application provides a robust platform for real-time communication and coordination between emergency service drivers and traffic police.

## Features

- **Multi-User System**: Supports three types of users - Guest, Traffic Police, and Emergency Services Drivers.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for fast, cloud-based authentication and data storage.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Implements a cloud-based messaging service for instant communication.
- **Multicast Communication**: Enables emergency service drivers to send notifications to multiple traffic police officers simultaneously.
- **Location Tracking**: Integrates Google Maps for real-time location sharing and route visualization.
- **Aid Management**: Allows drivers to create, update, and delete ongoing aid requests.

## Technology Stack

- Android Java
- Firebase (Authentication and Cloud Storage)
- Google Maps API
- Adobe XD (for UI/UX prototyping)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/virushere/RapidAid.git```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Configure Firebase in your project and add the necessary configuration files.
4. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. **Guest Users**: Can access open-source data without logging in.
2. **Traffic Police**: Log in to receive real-time notifications and manage traffic for emergency vehicles.
3. **Emergency Service Drivers**: Log in to send alerts, update aid status, and communicate with traffic police.

## Motivation

The project was inspired by the increasing death toll due to delayed emergency responses, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to provide a cost-effective, software-based solution to improve emergency response times and save lives.
